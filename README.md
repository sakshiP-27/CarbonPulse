# ðŸŒ±CarbonPulse

CarbonPulse is an application designed to help users estimate their carbon emissions based on logged activities. The aim is to raise environmental awareness by providing intuitive visualizations and actionable insights.

### Features

1. **Activity Logging**

   - A user can log their daily activities to keep a track of the carbon emissions they're causing through their actions based on which they can take on actionable insights.

2. **Real-Time Carbon Footprint Prediction**

   - Implemented ML algorithms through which the application predicts the user's estimated carbon emissions for the day through the previous activities performed by them, though which the user can be aware of their limit and perform their actions accordingly.

3. **Smart Recommendation**

   - Implemented NLP based techinques through which the application provides the user with recommendation on how the user can reduce their emissions, based on their daily activities performed at the end of the day.

### Acknowledgements

- [Carbon Interface API]("https://docs.carboninterface.com/#/?id=introduction") was used for smooth calculation and estimation of the carbon footprint produced based on the used activities.
- Inspiration was taken from [WWF]("https://support.wwf.org.uk/adoptions") and [The Nature Conservancy]("https://www.nature.org/en-us/get-involved/how-to-help/carbon-footprint-calculator/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
